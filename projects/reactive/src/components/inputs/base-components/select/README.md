# Select

**Note:** This component is a base component and not expected to be used directly.

This component utilizes the DropDown component to implement an input which has a tray focused on selecting options from a list. It provides filtering capability for that list along with keyboard control.

This component utilizes the [InputLabel](../base-input/README.md) component to implement the labeling for a input type control. The Select component supports all the same properties that the InputLabel component does.

## How to use
